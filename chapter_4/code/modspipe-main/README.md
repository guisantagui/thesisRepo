## Lineage-specific genome-scale metabolic model analysis pipeline.
Performs Flux Balance Analysis and Flux Sampling on the generated lineage-specific genome-scale metabolic models. With the resulting fluxes performs PCAs, OPLS-DA and ORA. <br>
Needs cobrapy to be installed (https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Input are the constructed lineage-specific models.
