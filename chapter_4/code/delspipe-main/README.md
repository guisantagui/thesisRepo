## Deletion analysis pipeline.
Performs unsupervised (PCA and CA) and supervised (Random Forests) on the deletion data. Binarizes deletion data with a given threshold (default = 15% deleted). Does univariate analysis between L4 and each one of the other lineages and filters significative genes to get genes that are lost in the majority of a lineage, with the aim of building lineage specific genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs). <br>
